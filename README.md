# Bones
__A Lightweight Wordpress Development Theme__

Bones is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built
using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It was updated recently
using some of the HTML5 Boilerplate's recommended markup and setup.
It's constantly growing so be sure to check back often if you are a
frequent user. I'm always open to contribution. :)

Designed by **Eddie Machado**: http://themble.com/bones

Special Thanks to:
* Paul Irish & the HTML5 Boilerplate
* Yoast for some WP functions & optimization ideas
* Andrew Rogers for code optimization
* David Dellanave for speed & code optimization
* and several other developers. :)
